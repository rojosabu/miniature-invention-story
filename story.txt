Once upon a time, way back in the kitchen cabinet was a wee little marshmallow. Quite vulnerable and small, the little marshmallow was afraid of the world outside the cabinet. The marshmallow felt weak next to the strong vegetables and fruits beside it, and was scared that it wouldn't be able to make it safely out of the cabinet without hurting itself. The little marshmallow turned to its friend, the apple, for advice.
The apple, in attempt to cheer up the marshmallow, said, "At least your expiration date is far in the future; do marshmallows even expire at all? I have only one week left until I am thrown into the trash. :(" Yes, I did just quote a frowny face. Move on please.
Hm. I'm not sure if I will be able to move on from the quoted smiley face... But, I will try. The marshmallow, after hearing the apple's story did, in fact feel a little better.
So the next day, the marshmallow finally got up the courage and jumped out of the cupboard!
And then it jumped into the pool below.

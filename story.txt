Once upon a time, way back in the kitchen cabinet was a wee little marshmallow. Quite vulnerable and small, the little marshmallow was afraid of the world outside the cabinet. The marshmallow felt weak next to the strong vegetables and fruits beside it, and was scared that it wouldn't be able to make it safely out of the cabinet without hurting itself. The little marshmallow turned to its friend, the apple, for advice.
